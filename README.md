.This is the code of  [<< Face Anti-Spoofing using Speeded-Up Robust Features and Fisher Vector Encoding >> ](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7748511/?reload=true)with my own trained model. You can download code of the user from [https://github.com/zboulkenafet/Face-Anti-Spoofing-using-Speeded-Up-Robust-Features-and-Fisher-Vector-Encoding](https://github.com/zboulkenafet/Face-Anti-Spoofing-using-Speeded-Up-Robust-Features-and-Fisher-Vector-Encoding)<br>
 . you can run ./Anti_Spoofing/live_demo.m to see the performance. <br>
 . This code has contained the trained model, but without any train data, due to the copyright issues.
